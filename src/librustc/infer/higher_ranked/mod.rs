         * Returns the set of region variables that do not affect any
         * types/regions which existed before `snapshot` was
         * started. This is used in the sub/lub/glb computations. The
         * idea here is that when we are computing lub/glb of two
         * regions, we sometimes create intermediate region variables.
         * Those region variables may touch some of the skolemized or
         * other "forbidden" regions we created to replace bound
         * regions, but they don't really represent an "external"
         * constraint.
         *
         * However, sometimes fresh variables are created for other
         * purposes too, and those *may* represent an external
         * constraint. In particular, when a type variable is
         * instantiated, we create region variables for all the
         * regions that appear within, and if that type variable
         * pre-existed the snapshot, then those region variables
         * represent external constraints.
         *
         * An example appears in the unit test
         * `sub_free_bound_false_infer`.  In this test, we want to
         * know whether
         *
         * ```rust
         * fn(_#0t) <: for<'a> fn(&'a int)
         * ```
         *
         * Note that the subtype has a type variable. Because the type
         * variable can't be instantiated with a region that is bound
         * in the fn signature, this comparison ought to fail. But if
         * we're not careful, it will succeed.
         *
         * The reason is that when we walk through the subtyping
         * algorith, we begin by replacing `'a` with a skolemized
         * variable `'1`. We then have `fn(_#0t) <: fn(&'1 int)`. This
         * can be made true by unifying `_#0t` with `&'1 int`. In the
         * process, we create a fresh variable for the skolemized
         * region, `'$2`, and hence we have that `_#0t == &'$2
         * int`. However, because `'$2` was created during the sub
         * computation, if we're not careful we will erroneously
         * assume it is one of the transient region variables
         * representing a lub/glb internally. Not good.
         *
         * To prevent this, we check for type variables which were
         * unified during the snapshot, and say that any region
         * variable created during the snapshot but which finds its
         * way into a type variable is considered to "escape" the
         * snapshot.
